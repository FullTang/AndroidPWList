# AndroidPWList
A small password list optimized for use against Android device passwords.

This list is just under 1GB in size and combines the following Weekpass (https://weakpass.com/wordlist/medium) wordlists:
`hk_hlm_founds.txt`
`ignis-10M.txt`
`kaonashi14M.txt`
`passwords.txt`
`real-pass_login.txt`
`rockyou.txt`
`SkullSecurityComp`
`Top29Million-probable-v2.txt`

The following optimizations were done to the list:

* Removed non-ASCII characters
* Combined / Deduplicated
* Length between 6 - 16 characters
* Alphanumeric passwords only
