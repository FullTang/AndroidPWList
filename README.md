# AndroidPWList
---
A small (>1GB) password list optimized for use against Android device passwords.

---

## Version 2
The following optimizations and improvements were made on top of Verson 1:

* Added `real_english.dic` from Weakpass.
* Added several smaller wordlists that used popular passwords
* Better sorting of the passwords by popularity with more common passwords at the top
* Converted characters that escaped HTML back to their ASCII equivalents (Thanks to @tycho for pointing this out.)
* Better deduplication / line endings normalization (Thanks to @tycho and @hops for pointers with this.)
